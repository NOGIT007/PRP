# Test Application Functionality

Comprehensive testing of your application's core features.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Basic Setup Test**
   ```bash
   # Check if everything installs and starts
   ./install.sh
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. **Core Functionality Tests**
   - Test main application features
   - Verify external integrations work
   - Check error handling
   - Validate user workflows

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Database connections
   - API endpoints
   - Authentication flows
   - External service integration

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Response times
   - Memory usage
   - Concurrent user handling
   - Resource consumption
